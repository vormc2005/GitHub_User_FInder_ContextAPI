GitHub Finder

GitHub Finder lets you search for git hub users using a search bar. Once user is found, user can click on "More" button and view GitHub user's profile with his or her repositories. Once value of the search is typed and submit button pressed, application makes API call to gitHub and finds a GitHub user.

User Story

1. As a user I would like to type name/login information of a GitHub user and be able to look at his or hers profile. So it I do not have to login or create GitHub account.
